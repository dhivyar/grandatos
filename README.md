## Grandatos Data Analytics Codes
User: https://github.com/dhivyar

## The Github repository Grandatos contains the following files:
* README.md - Explains how everything here in this repository works and how they are connected.
* Packages - All necessary packages for the script here to execute in your local.
* Scripts - The .R files that are each written to solve a specific Data Analytics question

## Steps:

Open RStudio and install R packages mentioned in Packages file if you don't have them already using the command install.packages("package name").
* Save the .R scripts in your local drive.
* Make the RStudio look in the same directory as in step 2 using the setwd("..") command.
* In the console window of RStudio, type: source("abc.R"), to bring the script to your local.
* The script will run and will take some time to execute since it has to download and perform analysis over a ~57MB data set.
* Once the script is run, the control will return back to the user in the console window.
* The output of the script will be stored in the same directory.
